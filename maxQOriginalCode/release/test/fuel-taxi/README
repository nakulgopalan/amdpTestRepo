Experiments with the Fuel Taxi

The fuel taxi MDP is very slow to converge for flat Q learning.  I
found that epsilon-greedy exploration worked best in this domain.
Load plot.gp into gnuplot to see a comparison of the methods.


flat-q.con        train flat q learning
flat-q.script

   I have retained three sub-ma-200 files for three different
   rates of cooling the epsilon-greedy exploration.  Fast cooling
   leads to an earlier rise in performance, but ultimately poorer
   performance.  

h-q.con           train hierarchical q learning
h-q.script      

To rerun the experiments, first go to the release directory and
make fq-fuel-agent and hq-fuel-agent.  Move those executables to this
directory and then run flat-q.script and/or h-q.script.

flat-hand-coded.script evaluates the hand-coded policy.
