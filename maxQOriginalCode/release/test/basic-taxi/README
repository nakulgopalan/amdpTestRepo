This is the simplest taxi domain.  No fuel, all actions deterministic.

We employ a learning rate of 1 in all of these scripts.

flat-hand-coded.script:  run with hand-coded policy.  This should be the
                    optimal policy.
                    
flat.script:        flat Q learning

h-hand-coded.script  run hand-coded hierarchical policy.

h-q.script:         hierarchical Q learning

plot.gp             command file for gnuplot to compare the four methods

To recreate these experiments, go to the release directory and do a
clean make of hq-agent and fq-agent and move the executables here.
Then execute each of the scripts.

Note that rerunning the scripts will clobber the sub-ma-200 files, so
if you want to make a comparison, you should rename those files first.
