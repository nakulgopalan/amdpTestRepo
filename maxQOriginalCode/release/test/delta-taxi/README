Experiments with the delta-taxi.  This is a version of the taxi
problem in which actions are noisy and the passenger can change the
destination one move after the pickup action. 

flat-hand-coded.script     Execute flat hand-coded policy
flat-hand-coded.con        Associated parameter file
        When this script completes, the last line of the file
        flat-hand-coded.mean gives the mean reward per trial over 5000
        trials. 

flat-q.script              Train with flat Q learning
flat-q.con

h-hand-coded.script        Execute hierarchical hand-coded policy
                           I believe this will be recursively optimal.

h-hand-coded.con

h-q.script                 Train hierarchical Q learning
h-q.con                    Associated parameter file.  Note that
                           significant effort has gone in to
                           determining separate exploration cooling
                           schedules for each subtask.

h-q-polling.script         Traing hierarchical Q learning with polling
                           execution.
h-q-polling.con

plot.gp                    Load this into gnuplot to plot performance.
                           

To reproduce these runs, go to the release directory and do a clean
make of fq-delta-agent and hq-delta-agent.  Move the executables here
and execute each of the script files.

Note that the script files will clobber the sub-ma-200 output files,
so to do a comparison, you should first rename these files.
